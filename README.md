# Predicting Apple Net Income

##Data Products Course Project for coursera:

This application will predict Apple's net income based from the number of sold iPhone and Macs units.
Prediction formula were derieved from Apple's SEC 10K data from 2005 to 2016.

ui.R: slifidy / R code for the input and output

server.R: slidify / R code to process input and small financial data

apple.csv : compiled data taken from Apple's 10K form. link: http://investor.apple.com/sec.cfm 

I have intentionally excluded other Apple revenue stream ( i.e. itunes, ipads, icloud ) to simplify prediction inputs.
This is a demo application,so do not use this as a financial tool.
