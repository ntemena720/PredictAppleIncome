 ui.R: Shiny/R code for the input and output

 server.R: Shiny/R code to process input and small financial data

AppleIncome-rpubs.html: Manual for using the app and displaying codes behind the prediction. This is a 5 page slider using R presentation

apple.csv : Compiled data taken from Apple's 10K form. link: http://investor.apple.com/sec.cfm 

I have intentionally excluded other Apple revenue stream ( i.e. itunes, ipads, icloud ) to simplify prediction inputs.

<strong>This is a demo application not a financial tool.</strong>
